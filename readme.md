# The Prisoner's Dilemma

The [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) is part of [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) and is an experiment involving two rational agents, each of whom can either cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner ("defect") for individual gain.

This project is a small Implementation of the Prisoner's Dilemma in order to test the results depending on each agent's strategy.
